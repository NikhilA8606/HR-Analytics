# HR-Analytics

Project Overview:
Our initiative aims to revolutionize HR practices at Atliq by harnessing insightful data to understand employee behavior and preferences. The deployment of a comprehensive dashboard enables us to delve into key terminologies like WFH (Work from Home), SL Count (Sick Leave Count), P (Present), HP (Half Pay Leave), PL (Pay Leave), WO (Weekly Off), and HO (Holiday Off). Leveraging these insights equips the HR team to craft tailored strategies that foster an environment conducive to heightened employee engagement and productivity.

Insights Unveiled:

Remote Work Trends: Our analysis uncovers a significant surge in employees opting for remote work, particularly on Fridays. This surge signifies a growing inclination towards flexible work arrangements, indicating a successful integration of remote work policies within our organization.

Sick Leave Patterns: Through careful monitoring of sick leave data, we gain profound insights into employee well-being trends. This data aids in identifying recurring patterns, facilitating the proactive implementation of wellness programs geared towards supporting our employees' physical and mental well-being.

Office Presence Dynamics: The analysis of office presence reveals intriguing trends, notably higher attendance on select days, signaling a preference for in-office collaboration and face-to-face interactions. Understanding these patterns enables us to optimize office spaces, foster stronger team dynamics, and facilitate seamless communication channels.

Strategic Adaptations:
These insights serve as catalysts for adapting HR strategies to foster a more flexible work environment while prioritizing a healthy work-life balance. Harnessing data-driven decisions empowers us to optimize employee experiences, propelling our organization towards heightened productivity and overall success.
